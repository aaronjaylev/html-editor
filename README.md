## Installation

This is more of a code snippet than a library. You can copy the 3 files (index.html, aaron-jay-lev-html-editor.js and aaron-jay-lev-html-editor.css) to your website or even your local machine, and you can use the WYSIWYG editor with no other dependencies (other than fontawesome).

## Licensing

You are free to use and modify this code but please leave the file as the "aaron-jay-lev-html-editor.js" or leave some other credit to me in your code. Thanks.

## Maintenance

If you have any feature requests, code suggestions or other suggestions, please send them along. This is for everyone!
